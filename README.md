# zebra-crossing-detection

Problem description 
For blind people or people with limited visual capabilities, traversing through the urban environment and busy streets and intersection is a challenging task. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021), millions of people around the world suffers from different types of visual impairment and thus need assistance when navigating outdoors. To tackle the mobility problem arising for visually impaired people, one solution is to identify a safe location to cross a street. Crosswalks are ideally the safest way for a visually impaired person to cross a road since they are the dedicated locations for pedestrian crossing. In this project, we consider the problem of detecting crosswalk crossings from the images or/and videos captured with the mobile device camera. To accomplish this, the YOLOv8 state of the art deep learning object detection is used.


Goal 
This main goal of this project is to formulate a workflow that allows the detection of crosswalk from images and videos taken by mobile phones. The findings could in the future be used by a guidance application for visually impaired persons. 
 
 
Our contribution   
To develop a crosswalk recognition algorithm using python and OpenCV. The algorithm will tell the visually impaired people where they are currently located relative to the crosswalk and guide them through the crosswalk by providing instructions to ensure that they do not deviate far from the center of crosswalk.
